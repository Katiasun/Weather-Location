# DEMO

[Weather-Location](https://katiasun.github.io/Weather-Location/)

## Planned Features

- [ ] Compare Multiple Locations: Add a feature to compare weather conditions across multiple locations. This will allow users to view side-by-side comparisons of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather parameters for better decision-making and regional climate analysis.

- [ ] Weather Guessing Game: Implement a game where users guess the location based on weather data provided. Users will have three tries to find the correct location, and the game can be played solo or with friends to add a competitive element.

- [ ] Improved Localization: Enhance the app's localization support by adding multiple languages and adapting the user interface to handle different regional settings, such as date formats and units of measurement. This will make the app more accessible to a global audience.

- [ ] Refactor App to Use Redux: Refactor the app's state management to use Redux. This will centralize state management, reduce prop drilling, and improve the app's scalability and maintainability.

- [ ] Modularize the Codebase: Break down the codebase into smaller, reusable components to improve maintainability and scalability. This modular approach will make the app more adaptable to future enhancements and easier for collaborative development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
